    <h2>Ashley Bradshaw</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Ashley Bradshaw. I am from Buckeye, Arizona. I am 19 years old, and the oldest of 6 kids. I have 1 sister and 4 brothers. In the picture above, I'm in the middle.</p>
    <p>Many of my interests include baking, drawing, crocheting, pottery, sewing, reading, painting, any form of art, swimming, cycling, hiking, camping, traveling, photo taking, fishing, kayaking, listening to music, creating music, spending time with my family, singing, dancing, building and creating all sorts of things, puzzles or solving puzzles in many forms, playing the piano and much more.As far as my musical experience goes, I have been playing for 7 to 8 years.</p>
    <p>My major is Software Development, and so far I am liking the things i have learned so far. As i have mentioned, I like to build things. So, i especially liked this activity in which i got to build a program for my introduction. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life, and although I don't have a favorite scripture, I know that I love immersing myself in the scriptures. Immersing myself into the scriptures along with praying to my Heavenly father allows me to follow the plan that he has for me.</p>
    </p>Aside from all things that i love to do that aren't digital. I love technology and I was intrigued about the Software development degree, which is the reason why I picked this major.Digitally, I have found digital drawings and logo making to be enjoyable. I also love building these programs from this class. I'm excited to learn more in this class!</p>
