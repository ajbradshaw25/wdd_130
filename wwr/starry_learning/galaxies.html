            <h1>Our Galaxy and Constellations</h1>
            <h3>Our home, the Milky Way, is one galaxy that you're able to see with your eyes. Just about everything you see in the night sky is part of it. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, it's round and flat like a giant frisbee. It has a big lump in the center and the edges spiral off like a pinwheel. The Sun and the rest of the Solar System are near the edge of the galaxy. However, even from our home near the Milky Way's border, the galaxy's closest edge is still millions of miles away. Altogether, the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years across the widest point. At its thick center, it is about 15,000 light years from top to bottom.</h3>
            <h3>On the clear nights, if you're far away from the bright lights in the city, you may be able to spot a wide hazy strip stretching all the way across the sky. That's part of the Milky Way! That haze is caused by the combined light of the billions of stars that make up the galaxy. That strip is a side view of the galaxy. It stretches on for thousands of light years into the distance. Along with the Milky Way, there are many other things to spot in the night sky, and you don't need a telescope or anything too fancy. There's a whole world of fascinating things you can observe and study from your backyard, the park, down the street or any other wide-open space. You can observe this whole world with just your eyes!</h3>
            <h3>When you look up at the stars at night, it might seem like stars are scattered randomly across the sky. But in fact, each star is part of a large collection of stars that are held together by their gravitational attraction: a galaxy. Some galaxies are so big that, even going in the fastest spaceship ever built, would take millions of years to get from one side to the other. The galaxy we live in is known as the Milky Way. Every galaxy is different, but there are 3 main types and 1 transitional type. </h3>

        <h3>Elliptical—</h3>
        <p>Elliptical galaxies are named after an ellipse, a oval shaped circle. Elliptical galaxies are round, but longer in one direction than the other. They have a smooth, even number and distribution of stars in them. Most of the galaxies in the universe are elliptical. </p>
        <h3>Spiral—</h3>
        <p>Flat, round clusters of stars with tails that spiral out of a thick, dense center are called spiral galaxies. These types of galaxies have a flattened disk with spiral arms. Spiral galaxies are the second most common type of galaxies. </p>
        <h3>Irregular—</h3>
        <p>Irregular galaxies have no regular or even a clear shape. They can appear wild, chaotic, even unbalanced. They often form from galactic collosions. This means that they form when two galaxies bump into each other, collide into eachother, and sometimes it happens when a galaxy gets pulled and twisted into a strange shape by a nearby galaxy. </p>

    <section class="msg6">
        <h3>Lenticular</h3>
        <p>This type of galaxy is a transitional type between spirals and elliptical. They have a disk like a spiral galaxy, but don't have spiral arms. They have little to no gas and dust. They are considered an in between type of galaxy. </p>

        <h1>Explore</h1>
        <p>Stargazing has been known to reduce stress, improve mood, and increase a feeling of awe. It doesn't take very much time at all either! Just taking at least 5 minutes out of your day to look at the moon or the stars up in the sky is enough. Additionally, it can be very intriguing and fun! </p>
