      <h3>Learning for Kids: Our galaxy and Constellations</h3>
      <p>
        When you look up at the stars at night, it might seem like stars are scattered randomly across the sky. But in fact, each star is part of a large collection of stars that are held together by their gravitational attraction: a galaxy.        
        Some galaxies are so big that, even going in the fastest spaceship ever built, would take millions of years to get from one side to the other. The galaxy we live in is known as the Milky Way. Every galaxy is different, but there are 3 main types and 1 transitional type:        
        Elliptical— 
        Elliptical galaxies are named after an ellipse, a oval shaped circle. Elliptical galaxies are round, but longer in one direction than the other. They have a smooth, even number and distribution of stars in them. Most of the galaxies in the universe are elliptical.         
        Spiral—
        Flat, round clusters of stars with tails that spiral out of a thick, dense center are called spiral galaxies. These types of galaxies have a flattened disk with spiral arms. Spiral galaxies are the second most common type of galaxies.       
        Irregular—
        Irregular galaxies have no regular or a clear defined shape. They can appear chaotic or unbalanced. They often form from galactic collisions, meaning when they bump into each other or it can happen when a galaxy is being pulled into a strange shape by another nearby galaxy.        
        Lenticular—
        This type of galaxy is a transitional type between spirals and elliptical. They have a disk like a spiral galaxy, but don't have spiral arms. They have little to no gas and dust. They are considered an in between type of galaxy.        
        Our home, the Milky Way, is one galaxy that you're able to see with your eyes. Just about everything you see in the night sky is part of it. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, it's round and flat like a giant frisbee. It has a big lump in the center and the edges spiral off like a pinwheel. The Sun and the rest of the Solar System are near the edge of the galaxy. However, even from our home near the Milky Way's border, the galaxy's closest edge is still millions of miles away. Altogether, the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years across the widest point. At its thick center, it is about 15,000 light years from top to bottom.         
        On the clear nights, if you're far away from the bright lights in the city, you may be able to spot a wide hazy strip stretching all the way across the sky. That's part of the Mily Way! That haze is caused by the combined light of the billions of stars that make up the galaxy. That's trip is a side view of the galaxy. It stretches on for thousands of light years into the distance. Along with the Mily Way, there are many other things to spot in the night sky, and you don't need a telescope or anything too fancy. There's a whole world of fascinating things you can observe and study from your backyard, the park, down the street or any other wide-open space. You can observe this whole world with just your eyes!        
        One of the many things to look for in the sky is constellations. Constellations are a group of stars that have become associated with (and named after) an object, animal or character. Constellations, and the stories behind them, make the stars easier and more fun to remember.
        When the first stargazers stared into the night sky, they saw shapes in the thousands of stars that dotted the night sky. By imagining lines between the points of light, they grouped stars together into pictures called constellations.       
        One of the biggest and most brilliant constellations in the night sky is Orion. He's a hunter holding a bow like an archer. He has a belt made up of 3 bright stars. In addition, the supergiant star called Betelgeuse (BEETLE-juice) can be found on his left shoulder. Betelgeuse is Arabic for “shoulder of the giant.” Another bright star located in Orion, known as Rigel (RYE-gel), makes up his right knee.
        There are also many other constellations and cosmic objects like planets, comets asteroids, and shooting stars to see under the night sky. I encourage you to get out there and begin your astronomical journey by stargazing.
