      <h3>Learning for Kids: Our galaxy and Constellations</h3>
      <p>
        When you look up at the stars at night, it might seem like stars are scattered randomly across the sky. But in fact, each star is part of a large collection of stars that are held together by their gravitational attraction: a galaxy.
        Some galaxies are so big that, even going in the fastest spaceship ever built, would take millions of years to get from one side to the other. The galaxy we live in is known as the Milky Way. Every galaxy is different, but there are 3 main types and 1 transitional type:</p>       
      <h3>
        Elliptical—</h3>
      <p>
        Elliptical galaxies are named after an ellipse, a oval shaped circle. Elliptical galaxies are round, but longer in one direction than the other. They have a smooth, even number and distribution of stars in them. Most of the galaxies in the universe are elliptical.</p>        
      <h3>
        Spiral—</h3>
      <p>
        Flat, round clusters of stars with tails that spiral out of a thick, dense center are called spiral galaxies. These types of galaxies have a flattened disk with spiral arms. Spiral galaxies are the second most common type of galaxies.</p>    
      <h3>
        Irregular—</h3>
      <p>
        Irregular galaxies have no regular or a clear defined shape. They can appear chaotic or unbalanced. They often form from galactic collisions, meaning when they bump into each other or it can happen when a galaxy is being pulled into a strange shape by another nearby galaxy.</p>  
      <h3>
        Lenticular—</h3>
      <p>
        This type of galaxy is a transitional type between spirals and elliptical. They have a disk like a spiral galaxy, but don't have spiral arms. They have little to no gas and dust. They are considered an in between type of galaxy.</p>    
      <p>
        Our home, the Milky Way, is one galaxy that you're able to see with your eyes. Just about everything you see in the night sky is part of it. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, it's round and flat like a giant frisbee. It has a big lump in the center and the edges spiral off like a pinwheel. The Sun and the rest of the Solar System are near the edge of the galaxy. However, even from our home near the Milky Way's border, the galaxy's closest edge is still millions of miles away. Altogether, the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years across the widest point. At its thick center, it is about 15,000 light years from top to bottom.</p>      
      <p>
        On the clear nights, if you're far away from the bright lights in the city, you may be able to spot a wide hazy strip stretching all the way across the sky. That's part of the Milky Way! That haze is caused by the combined light of the billions of stars that make up the galaxy. That strip is a side view of the galaxy. It stretches on for thousands of light years into the distance. Along with the Milky Way, there are many other things to spot in the night sky, and you don't need a telescope or anything too fancy. There's a whole world of fascinating things you can observe and study from your backyard, the park, down the street or any other wide-open space. You can observe this whole world with just your eyes!</p>     
      <p>
        One of the many things to look for in the sky is constellations. Constellations are a group of stars that have become associated with (and named after) an object, animal or character. Constellations, and the stories behind them, make the stars easier and more fun to remember.
        When the first stargazers stared into the night sky, they saw shapes in the thousands of stars that dotted the night sky. By imagining lines between the points of light, they grouped stars together into pictures called constellations.</p>   
      <p>
        One of the biggest and most brilliant constellations in the night sky is Orion. He's a hunter holding a bow like an archer. He has a belt made up of 3 bright stars. In addition, the supergiant star called Betelgeuse (BEETLE-juice) can be found on his left shoulder. Betelgeuse is Arabic for “shoulder of the giant.” Another bright star located in Orion, known as Rigel (RYE-gel), makes up his right knee.
        There are also many other constellations and cosmic objects like planets, comets asteroids, and shooting stars to see under the night sky. I encourage you to get out there and begin your astronomical journey by stargazing!</p>

      <h3>Learning for Adults: Galaxies and Nebulae</h3>
      <p>
        Every star you see in the night sky belongs to the Milky Way, so whenever you look up, whether you are seeing the sun or bright stars, you are seeing a part of our galaxy. The only exception is the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>
      <p>
        Most of the objects you can see in the night sky are stars. However, if you start to get interested in astronomy and what lies beyond our planet, you will soon start to learn about deep-sky objects that are not stars. There are three main kinds of deep-sky objects you can spot from Earth. Some of these can be seen with the naked eye while others come to life through binoculars or telescopes. Broadly, these are nebula, star clusters, and galaxies.</p>
      <h2>
        NEBULAE</h2>
      <p>
        Nebulae are clouds of dust and gas that have gathered under gravity but are not dense enough for stars to begin to form yet. Eventually, the gas will collapse together, and stars will start to form. Until then, the gases stick together in nebulous clouds, hence the name. A nebula was first used to describe anything in space that was not tightly packed together, and galaxies beyond our own used to be called nebulae. Now, it only refers to clouds of helium, hydrogen, and other gases.
        Typically, the gaseous nebulae are the only ones you will be able to see with the naked eye. Planetary nebulae are shells of gas surrounding remnants of old stars, instead of gaseous nebulae which are related to the birth of stars. Planetary nebulae appear after a red giant star has shrunk and has become white dwarf. They got their name because, through a telescope they appear like a glowing disk which looks similar to a planet.</p>
      <p>
        There are many ways a star can die, but the most dramatic is a supernova. A supernova is the explosion and collapse of a giant star. After which, the majority of the star's material is ejected into the space surrounding the leftover neutron star or black hole. This material looks similar to other nebulae but is created in a completely different way. An example of this is the Crab nebula, which has a apparent magnitude of 8.4, which means you'll need a telescope or binoculars to find it. It is found in the constellation Taurus.
        Another type of nebula is dark nebulae. Dark nebulae can have an effect that blocks out the light from stars beyond them, because the gas is so tightly packed together. Most dark nebulae are found along the plane of the Milky Way, especially in the Great Rift, which can be found in the Milky Way.</p>
      <h2>
        GALAXIES</h2>
      <p>
        Galaxies are systems of stars clumped together through gravity, and most of them have a supermassive black hole at the center, which helps them to stick together, with its immense gravitational pull. Galaxies can range from small to large. The largest one, IC 1101, has about one hundred trillion stars at an estimate, while the smallest galaxies can have as few as a few hundred to a few thousand stars, which makes them a ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. Dwarf galaxies contain a few thousand stars, while your average galaxy contains a few billion to several hundred billion stars on average. The Milky Way, for example, is estimated to have around 100-400 billion stars. There are three main types of galaxies, spiral, elliptical and irregular.</p>
      <h3>
        Elliptical—</h3>
      <p>
        Elliptical galaxies are typically oval or spherical in shape, which is where their name comes from. They have a smooth, even distribution of stars and they lack the distinct spiral arms and disk found in spiral galaxies. Most of the galaxies in the universe are elliptical. Stars in elliptical galaxies tend to be older.</p>
      <h3>
        Spiral—</h3>
      <p>
        These galaxies have a flattened disk with spiral arms extending from a central bulge. The spiral arms are regions of active star formation, with younger stars, gas, and dust. The central bulge contains older stars. Our own Milky Way galaxy is a spiral galaxy. Some spiral galaxies have a bar-shaped structure in the center, and so those are called barred spiral galaxies. Spiral galaxies are the second most common type of galaxies.</p>
      <h3>
        Irregular—</h3>
      <p>
        Irregular galaxies do not have a regular or defined shape, so they can appear chaotic or asymmetrical. They often result from galactic collisions or interactions, meaning when they bump into each other or when a galaxy is being pulled in by another nearby galaxy, causing them to collide and form a galaxy with an irregular shape.</p>
      <h3>
        Lenticular—</h3>
      <p>
        This type of galaxy is not part of the main types of galaxies, because it is a class of its own. It is an in-between of a spiral and an elliptical galaxy. This type of galaxy is considered to be a transitional type of galaxy. The reason being is because while they have a disk like a spiral galaxy, they lack the spiral arms like an elliptical galaxy. They also have little to no gas and dust.</p>
      <p>
        The smallest galaxies have one hundred million stars, while the largest galaxies have one hundred million. Within the universe, galaxies are organized into groups, clusters, and super clusters. In our galaxy, which is a spiral galaxy, there are one hundred billion stars, and there are trillions of galaxies out there in our observable universe. The galaxies that are closest to our own make up a group called the Local Group, which contains about fifty-one galaxies.
        The closest large galaxy is Andromeda or M31. Andromeda is found near the constellations of Pegasus, and Andromeda. It is the only big galaxy that is visible to the naked eye. This makes it the most distant and oldest object you can see with the naked eye. It lies two and a half million light years away. The Andromeda galaxy is much larger than ours, it contains one trillion stars.</p>
