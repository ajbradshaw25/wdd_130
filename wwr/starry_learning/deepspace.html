            <h1>Interstellar Objects</h1>
            <p>Every star you see in the night sky belongs to the Milky Way, so whenever you look up, whether you're seeing the sun or bright stars, you are seeing a part of the galaxy we live in. The only exception is the Andromeda Galaxy. Andromeda is visoble in the night sky because it's the galaxy closest to us, and it's just close enough for it to be visible in the night sky.</p>
            <p>Most of the objects you can observe and take a look at in the night sky are stars. However, if you're interested and have learned more about astronomy, then you'll begin to learn more about what lies beyond our planet. One of the things you'll learn about are deep-sky objects that aren't the trillions and trilions of stars. There are many to discover and learn about such as dark matter, star clusters, nebulae, galaxies, planets, exoplanets, and many more. Here I will only explain two of them to start with. Broadly, all of the deep-sky objects can either be seen with the naked eye or with binoculars or telescope. Here I will explain Galaxies and Nebulae.</p>

        <h1>Galaxies</h1>
        <h3>Elliptical—</h3>
        <p>Elliptical galaxies are named after an ellipse, a oval shaped circle. Elliptical galaxies are round, but longer in one direction than the other. They have a smooth, even number and distribution of stars in them. Most of the galaxies in the universe are elliptical. </p>
        <h3>Spiral—</h3>
        <p>Flat, round clusters of stars with tails that spiral out of a thick, dense center are called spiral galaxies. These types of galaxies have a flattened disk with spiral arms. Spiral galaxies are the second most common type of galaxies. </p>
        <h3>Irregular—</h3>
        <p>Irregular galaxies have no regular or even a clear shape. They can appear wild, chaotic, even unbalanced. They often form from galactic collosions. This means that they form when two galaxies bump into each other, collide into eachother, and sometimes it happens when a galaxy gets pulled and twisted into a strange shape by a nearby galaxy. </p>

    <section class="msg6">
        <h3>Lenticular</h3>
        <p>This type of galaxy is a transitional type between spirals and elliptical. They have a disk like a spiral galaxy, but don't have spiral arms. They have little to no gas and dust. They are considered an in between type of galaxy. </p>

        <h1>Constellations</h1>
        <p>One of the many things to look for in the sky is constellations. Constellations are a group of stars that have become associated with (and named after) an object, animal or character. Constellations, and the stories behind them, make the stars easier and more fun to remember. When the first stargazers stared into the night sky, they saw shapes in the thousands of stars that dotted the night sky. By imagining lines between the points of light, they grouped stars together into pictures called constellations. </p>
        <p>One of the biggest and most brilliant constellations in the night sky is Orion. He's a hunter holding a bow like an archer. He has a belt made up of 3 bright stars. In addition, the supergiant star called Betelgeuse (BEETLE-juice) can be found on his left shoulder. Betelgeuse is Arabic for “shoulder of the giant.” Another bright star located in Orion, known as Rigel (RYE-gel), makes up his right knee. There are also many other constellations and cosmic objects like planets, comets asteroids, and shooting stars to see under the night sky. I encourage you to get out there and begin your astronomical journey by stargazing!</p>
