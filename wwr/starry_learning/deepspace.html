            <h1>Interstellar Objects</h1>
            <p>Every star you see in the night sky belongs to the Milky Way, so whenever you look up, whether you're seeing the sun or bright stars, you are seeing a part of the galaxy we live in. The only exception is the Andromeda Galaxy. Andromeda is visoble in the night sky because it's the galaxy closest to us, and it's just close enough for it to be visible in the night sky.</p>
            <p>Most of the objects you can observe and take a look at in the night sky are stars. However, if you're interested and have learned more about astronomy, then you'll begin to learn more about what lies beyond our planet. One of the things you'll learn about are deep-sky objects that aren't the trillions and trilions of stars. There are many to discover and learn about such as dark matter, star clusters, nebulae, galaxies, planets, exoplanets, and many more. Here I will only explain two of them to start with. Broadly, all of the deep-sky objects can either be seen with the naked eye or with binoculars or telescope. Here I will explain Galaxies and Nebulae.</p>

        <h1>Nebulae</h1>
        <p>Nebulae are clouds of dust and gas that have gathered under gravity, but they're not quite dense enough for stars to form yet. Eventually, these gases will collapse together, and a star will commence its formation. Until then, the gases stick together in nebulous clouds, hence the name. A nebula was intially used to describe anything in outer space that was not tightly packed together, and so at the time, galaxies beyond our own were called nebulae. </p>
        <p>Now, nebulae only refers to clouds of helium, hydrogen, and other gases. Typically, the gaseous nebulae are the only ones you'll be able to see with the naked eye. Planetary nebulae are shells of gas surrounding remnants of old stars. Gaseous Nebulae are related and correspond with the birth of stars. While on the other hand, planetary nebulae are related to and correspond towards the end of a star's life. Planetary Nebulae appear after a red giant star has shrunk and has become a white dwarf. They got this name because, through a telescope, they appear like a glowing disk which looks similar to a planet. Another thing to note is that towards a star's life, depending on it's size, they either go supernova then turn into a black hole or neutron star, Or they fade away gently into a white dwarf with a planetary nebula and eventually they turn into a black dwarf.</p>

        <h1>Stars</h1>
        <p>There are many ways a star can die, but the most dramatic is a supernova. A supernova is the explosion and collapse of a giant star. After which, the majority of the star's material is ejected into the space surrounding the leftover neutron star or black hole. This material looks similar to other nebulae but is created in a completely different way. An example of this is the Crab Nebula, which has a apparent magnitude of 8.4, which means you'll need a telescope or binoculars to find it. It is found in the constellation Taurus. The Crab Nebula is shown above. Another type of nebula is dark nebulae. Dark nebulae can have an effect that blocks out the light from stars beyond them, because the gas is so tightly packed together. Most dark nebulae are found along the plane of the Milky Way, especially in the Great Rift, which can be found in the Milky Way.</p>

        <h1>More about Galaxies</h1>
        <h3>The smallest galaxies have one hundred million stars, while the largest galaxies have one hundred million. Within the universe, galaxies are organized into groups, clusters, and super clusters. In our galaxy, which is a spiral galaxy, there are one hundred billion stars, and there are trillions of galaxies out there in our observable universe. The galaxies that are closest to our own make up a group called the Local Group, which contains about fifty-one galaxies. The closest large galaxy is Andromeda or M31. Andromeda is found near the constellations of Pegasus, and Andromeda. It is the only big galaxy that is visible to the naked eye. This makes it the most distant and oldest object you can see with the naked eye. It lies two and a half million light years away. The Andromeda galaxy is much larger than ours, it contains one trillion stars. </h3>

        <h1>Galaxies</h1>
        <p>Galaxies are systems of stars clumped together through gravity, and most of them have a supermassive black hole at the center, which helps them to stick together, with its immense gravitational pull. Galaxies can range from small to large. The largest one, IC 1101, has about one hundred trillion stars at an estimate, while the smallest galaxies can have as few as a few hundred to a few thousand stars, which makes them a ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. Dwarf galaxies contain a few thousand stars, while your average galaxy contains a few billion to several hundred billion stars on average. The Milky Way, for example, is estimated to have around 100-400 billion stars. There are three main types of galaxies, spiral, elliptical and irregular. </p>
        <h3>Elliptical—</h3>
        <p>Elliptical galaxies are typically oval or spherical in shape, which is where their name comes from. They have a smooth, even distribution of stars and they lack the distinct spiral arms and disk found in spiral galaxies. Most of the galaxies in the universe are elliptical. Stars in elliptical galaxies tend to be older. </p>
        <h3>Spiral—</h3>
        <p>These galaxies have a flattened disk with spiral arms extending from a central bulge. The spiral arms are regions of active star formation, with younger stars, gas, and dust. The central bulge contains older stars. Our own Milky Way galaxy is a spiral galaxy. Some spiral galaxies have a bar-shaped structure in the center, and so those are called barred spiral galaxies. Spiral galaxies are the second most common type of galaxies. </p>
        <h3>Irregular—</h3>
        <p>Irregular galaxies do not have a regular or defined shape, so they can appear chaotic or asymmetrical. They often result from galactic collisions or interactions, meaning when they bump into each other or when a galaxy is being pulled in by another nearby galaxy, causing them to collide and form a galaxy with an irregular shape. </p>
        <h3>Lenticular</h3>
        <p>This type of galaxy is not part of the main types of galaxies, because it is a class of its own. It is an in-between of a spiral and an elliptical galaxy. This type of galaxy is considered to be a transitional type of galaxy. The reason being is because while they have a disk like a spiral galaxy, they lack the spiral arms like an elliptical galaxy. They also have little to no gas and dust.</p>
